# ERC-20 Token Transfer DApp

This DApp allows users to transfer ERC-20 tokens between accounts on the Ethereum blockchain. It includes a smart contract implemented in Solidity, a frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and instructions for deployment and testing on an Ethereum test network.

## Project Overview

This DApp uses an ERC-20 smart contract to facilitate token transfers. Users can:

1. Connect their MetaMask wallet.
2. Check the token balance of any Ethereum address.
3. Transfer tokens to other addresses.

The smart contract is deployed on an Ethereum test network, allowing users to safely interact with it without using real funds.

## Features

- ERC-20 compliant smart contract for token transfers.
- Web interface for connecting a wallet, viewing balances, and transferring tokens.
- Deployment and testing on the Rinkeby or Goerli test network.

## Prerequisites

To set up and run this DApp, you will need:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) browser extension
- [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) or [Truffle](https://trufflesuite.com/) / [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) for contract deployment
- [Web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/) library

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/erc20-token-dapp.git
   cd erc20-token-dapp
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   For the frontend, ensure you have the [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/) library:

   ```
   npm install web3
   ```

3. **Add ABI File**  
   Save the ABI JSON file from Remix or Hardhat as `abi.json` in the root of your project. Update your frontend JavaScript file to import this ABI file.

4. **Setup MetaMask for Test Network**
   - Open MetaMask and switch to the desired test network (e.g., Rinkeby or Goerli).
   - Add test ETH to your MetaMask wallet from a faucet (you can search for Rinkeby or Goerli faucet).

## Smart Contract Deployment

1. **Write the Smart Contract**  
   Create an ERC-20 token contract in Solidity.

2. **Deploy Using Remix or Truffle/Hardhat**

   - **Remix**: Compile the contract, then deploy on the test network by connecting MetaMask as the injected provider.
   - **Truffle/Hardhat**: Run `truffle migrate --network rinkeby` or `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network rinkeby`.

3. **Save Contract Address and ABI**  
   After deploying, copy the deployed contract address. Save this address and the ABI JSON in your frontend code (e.g., in `main.js` or `app.js`).

## Frontend Setup

1. **Connect to the Contract**

   Update your frontend code with the contract address and ABI.

   ```javascript
   const contractAddress = "YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS";
   const abi = YOUR_ABI; // Import or paste your ABI here
   ```

2. **Frontend HTML File**

   Ensure your HTML includes the following sections:

   - **Connect Wallet**: Button to connect MetaMask
   - **Check Balance**: Input for address and button to check balance
   - **Transfer Tokens**: Inputs for recipient address and amount, plus a button to transfer

## Testing the DApp

1. **Connect Wallet**

   - Open your frontend (`index.html`) in a browser.
   - Click "Connect Wallet" to link your MetaMask account.

2. **Check Balance**

   - Enter an address in the "Check Balance" field.
   - Click "Check Balance" and verify the result.

3. **Transfer Tokens**
   - Enter a recipient address and amount in the transfer fields.
   - Click "Transfer" and confirm the transaction in MetaMask.
   - Check the balance to confirm that tokens were transferred.

## Screenshots

Include screenshots of:

1. **MetaMask Wallet Connected**: Showing the wallet connected in your DApp.
2. **Token Balance Check**: Displaying the token balance of an address.
3. **Token Transfer Confirmation**: Verifying a successful token transfer.

Replace `YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` and `YOUR_ABI` with your actual contract address and ABI. Also, add the necessary screenshots to document the DApp’s features and processes as required.
